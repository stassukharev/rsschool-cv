### **Short info**

At any age I try to develop in step with the times, to study new technologies in the field in which I am engaged. I set a goal to engage in large long-term projects and in the future to climb the career ladder, so that later I would give my knowledge to other people and make an important contribution to the business I am doing. <br/>My experience in IT is two years in ui/ux design. Various projects were implemented - landing pages, business cards, stores, mobile applications. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, completed the course in code-basics HTML for beginners, completed the Version Control with Git course at [elearn.epam.com](https://elearn.epam.com/), at the moment there is a desire to delve into the development process.
